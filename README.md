# How to Play Disk Golf
This tutorial will teach you how to play disk golf! Why? Because it is fun and more exciting than regular golf.

## Objective
Throw your disk into each basket in the least amount of throws possible.

## Materials Needed
You will need two types of disks: a driver for long-range throws and a putter for short-range throws.

## Warning
Make sure to avoid getting hit by flying disks.

### Steps
**1. Determine your group order (Skip to step 2 if playing alone)**
- Before you start your first basket, determine the order of who will throw as a group.
**2. Locating your Basket**
- Next to the throwing platform, look at the map indicating the location of the basket and determine the direction you need to throw.
**3. Gripping the Disk**
- Grab your driver and step onto the throwing platform.
- Use your dominant hand to hold the disk.
- Place all your fingers except your thumb on the edge of the underside of the disk.
- Place your thumb on the surface and have a firm grip.
  - (See the figure above for how the grip should look)
